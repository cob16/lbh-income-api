    # What a NOSP is:
    #
    # Expires Date is when the NOSP can now be actioned upon.
    #   The Tenant has 28 days to pay the arrears before Court action can take place.
    #   This is the "cooling off period".
    #
    # Served - This is when there is a date from UH
    # Cool off Period - This is the period from NOSP served to 28 days after
    # Active - This when the Tenant can be taken to court if the arrears are "high" enough; after
    #          the cooling off period.
    # Valid - This is during the cooling off period and when the NOSP is "active".
